## About Pure Chat

#### Chat with customers from the dashboard
Customers can easily start chats from their phone or tablet when you have Pure Chat’s desktop and mobile-optimized chat box on your site. You can also use the web or mobile apps to respond to new chat requests from anywhere!

#### See who's on your site in real time
Find and start a chat with qualified leads using visitor tracking software.
It shows which page a visitor is on, where they were referred from, and whether they’ve talked to your team before.
